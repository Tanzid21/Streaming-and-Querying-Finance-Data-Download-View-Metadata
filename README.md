# Streaming-and-Querying-Finance-Data-Download-View-Metadata
This project implements a real-time data pipeline using AWS Lambda, Kinesis, Glue, Athena, and S3 to fetch, process, store, and visualize stock price data. The pipeline collects financial data using yfinance, streams it to Kinesis, stores it in S3, catalogs it with Glue, analyzes it in Athena, and visualizes results in Jupyter Notebook.
